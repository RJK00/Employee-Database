#Employee Database

This database containing sample employee data was constructed for the purpose of
demonstrating the fundamentals of data modeling, data engineering, and analysis.

Methods:

First, an ERD was designed for the given data, and an adjacent schema was created. 

After importing the CSV data into a SQL database, various queries were performed to retrieve relevant data.

Lastly, the database was imported to pandas using SQLAlchemy and additional visualizations were created in Jupyter Notebook with Plotly.
